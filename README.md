# PiRA-zero-firmware
Firmware for PiRa Zero board implementing hardware interface functions.

## Software support for hardware features
 * USB charger BQ24296 I2c
 * RTC DS3231 I2C
 * ADC MCP3021 I2C
 * Display SSD1306 I2C
 * RFM95 Lora SPI

## Board support package
 * GPIO for power scheduling
 * GPIO for power output

### Power scheduling
On boot:
 1. Detect power-up trigger
  * if BCM17 (Timer-EN) is LOW then
    * Self-enable, if reboot and BCM18 is HIGH
    * else Timer enable
    * corner case, reboot due to self enable and timer at the same time, must clear timer in any case
  * if BCM 22 is LOW then
    * RTC enable if alarm is high, check via I2C
    * else enabled due to charging
  * none of the above, handle by resetting all timing soruces
 1. Self-enable GPIO BCM 18 to stay turned on
 1. Reset timing sources
  * assert Done for Timer on BCM27
  * reset RTC alarms

 During operation:
  1. monitor BCM17 and BCM22 for changes, repeat Detect power-up if needed

 On Shutdown:
  1. Check RTC wakeup is at least 30s away from now.
  1. do shutdown


### Application specific features
 1. Capture camera image and check for daylight/minimal light in image (maybe https://github.com/pageauc/pi-timolo)
 1. WiFi connect and hotspot https://github.com/resin-io/resin-wifi-connect
 1. Capture video for some time if sufficient light is available
 1. Measure distance with MB7092XL-MaxSonar-WRMA1
 1. Send data to TheThingsNetwork
 1. Send data over RockBlock Iridium modem

## Supported environment variables

The following environment variables can be used to configure the firmware:

* Global
  * `SLEEP_WHEN_CHARGING` (default `0`) when set to `1` the unit will sleep while it is charging.
  * `SLEEP_NEVER` (default `0`) when set to `1` the unit will never go to sleep.
  * `WIFI_WHEN_NOT_CHARGING` (default `1`) when set to `0` wifi will be disable while not charging.
  * `MODULES` a comma separated list of modules to load.
* Scheduler
  * `SCHEDULE_START` (default `08:00`)
  * `SCHEDULE_END` (default `18:00`)
  * `SCHEDULE_T_ON` (default `15`)
  * `SCHEDULE_T_OFF` (default `35`)
* Camera
  * `CAMERA_RESOLUTION` (default `1280x720`)
  * `CAMERA_VIDEO_DURATION` (default `until-sleep`, duration in minutes or `off`)
  * `CAMERA_MIN_LIGHT_LEVEL` (default `0.0`, minimum required for video to start recording)
* Rockblock
  * `ROCKBLOCK_REPORT_INTERVAL` (default `24`)
  * `ROCKBLOCK_RETRIES` (default `2`)
* LoRa
  * `LORA_DEVICE_ADDR`
  * `LORA_NWS_KEY`
  * `LORA_APPS_KEY`
  * `LORA_SPREAD_FACTOR` (default `7`)
